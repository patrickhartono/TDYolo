# Gemini CLI History for TDYolo Project

This document logs all interactions and changes made to the TDYolo project through the Gemini CLI.

## Session 1: July 5, 2025

### Project Setup & Initial Analysis
- **Directory Change**: Moved to the project directory `/Users/patrickhartono/Documents/TD-Experiment/TD-Py/TDYolo`.
- **Directory Listing**: Listed contents of the main project directory, identifying `Backup/`, `python-script/`, `.toe` files, and `yolo11n.pt`.
- **Subdirectory Navigation**: Moved into the `python-script/` subdirectory and listed its contents (`extCondaEnv.py`, `main-TDYolo.py`).
- **Code Analysis**: Performed a detailed analysis of `main-TDYolo.py`, explaining its functionality as a TouchDesigner script for real-time YOLO object detection, including hardware optimization (MPS/CUDA/CPU), custom parameters, and output to DAT tables.

### Conda Environment Management
- **Environment Listing**: Listed available Conda environments (`conda env list`).
- **Environment Context**: Clarified that the CLI operates in isolated sessions, but committed to running future Python commands within the `yolo11-TD` Conda environment using `conda run -n yolo11-TD ...`.
- **Environment Export**: Exported the `yolo11-TD` Conda environment to `environment.yml` to facilitate project sharing and reproducibility for other users.
- **Environment File Modification**: Modified `environment.yml` to remove the `name:` and `prefix:` lines, allowing users to choose their own environment name upon creation.
- **MPS Support Verification**: Confirmed that the `yolo11-TD` environment's PyTorch installation supports MPS (`torch.backends.mps.is_available()` returned `True`), ensuring optimal performance on Apple Silicon Macs.

### Version Control (Git) Integration
- **Git Initialization**: Confirmed that the `/Users/patrickhartono/Documents/TD-Experiment/TD-Py/TDYolo` directory was already a Git repository (though uncommitted).
- **Initial Commit**: Renamed the default branch from `master` to `main`.
- **Initial Commit**: Added all existing project files (`.DS_Store`, `Backup/`, `.toe` files, `environment.yml`, `python-script/`, `yolo11n.pt`) to the Git repository with the commit message "Initial commit for TDYolo project: Add project files and conda environment config".

## Session 2: July 7, 2025

### Code Refactoring
- **Code Review**: Reviewed the `python-script/main-TDYolo.py` script and identified that the `onCook` function was overly complex and could be improved for readability and maintainability.
- **Refactoring**: Broke down the `onCook` function into smaller, more manageable helper functions.
- **Git Commit**: Committed the refactored script to the Git repository with the message "Refactor: Modularize main-TDYolo.py for clarity".

### Revert Refactoring
- **Issue Identification**: The user reported that the refactoring broke existing functionality in the TouchDesigner project.
- **Revert Action**: Used `git revert` to undo the problematic commit (`de41d6c`). This restored `python-script/main-TDYolo.py` to its previous working state.
- **Git Commit**: Committed the revert action with the message "Revert \"Refactor: Modularize main-TDYolo.py for clarity\"".

### Conda Environment Creation
- **New Environment**: Created a new Conda environment named `yolo11Git-test` using `environment.yml`.

### Object Detection Visualization Enhancements
- **Indexed Labels**: Modified `main-TDYolo.py` to display indexed labels (e.g., "person 1", "person 2") on bounding boxes.
- **Text Boldness Fix**: Adjusted text thickness to remove bolding from labels.
- **Consistent Class Colors**: Implemented a system to assign a consistent, unique color (from a predefined palette) to each detected object class for its bounding box and label background. Text color remains white.
- **Color Palette Update**: Removed yellow from the color palette based on user feedback.
